				Welcome to the Contrast Crew website.<br>
				My name is Gabe, and this website was one of my many ongoing projects that got left on the back burner due to real life responsibilities getting in the way.<br>
				I feel guilty about how this project was essentially abandoned by me, not only because it was a good idea that went to waste, but because I had dragged other people into it, they were just a handful of community members from the <abbr title="Federation of United Nerfers">FUN</abbr> who volunteered their time, experience, and knowledge to this project, and I feel as though I let them down.<br>
				If you were one of those people, I'm incredibly sorry about this, and I hope to make it up to you with how I intend to continue this project.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="right_paragraph">
				For those of you who may be unaware, this site was going to be a one-stop shop for all sorts of information regarding Nerf as a hobby, it would've had in-depth information regarding safety, it would've had information and mod guides about many Hasbro and Non-Hasbro blasters, it would've had links to various nerf-related communities and shops, it would've even had learning resources on HPA (Which I intended to bathe in disclaimers and warnings, and not publish until getting the input of many people experienced in HPA).<br>
				<br>
				Yes it was kind of ambitious, but I see it as completely do-able, and my mistake was that I tried to do it all with a small team with me taking on the role of being the sole web-dev.<br>
				The way I intend to restart and continue this project is through behind-the-scenes work being done to get it to some basic level of information, fill out an FAQ, get some info done on some common blasters, etc etc.<br>
				After this is done, I intend to publish the site on Github, making it open source and allowing people to contribute their own knowledge to the site while following certain guidelines that we could easily put in the readme.<br>
				<br>
				Me and a handful of people I know I can trust would have authority on what changes/additions get put on the site, but anyone would be able to request a change, whether it be something small like a spelling correction, or something big like a whole new page aboput something the site hasn't covered.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="left_paragraph">
				Yet again I must say I am really sorry to those of you who I dragged into this, I promise I won't let this project die, as it could do a lot of good for the community.<br>
				Please enjoy the rest of your day, and check back soon!<br>
				<br>
